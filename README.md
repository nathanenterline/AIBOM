## Abstract 

  The increasing reliance on complex software and Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has intensified the need for transparency and security in supply chain management. The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and the Artificial Intelligence Bill of Materials (AIBOM) aim to address these needs by providing detailed component inventories for software and AI systems, respectively. This research explores the current challenges, limitations, and opportunities for improving the SBOM and AIBOM, emphasizing the need for standardization, enhanced tooling, and robust vulnerability databases such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). This research also examines the regulatory and compliance implications of implementing these frameworks, particularly in light of emerging global standards and AI-specific guidelines. Findings highlight the critical need for a unified SBOM standard, further research into AIBOM formats, and improvements to the NVD to better support both frameworks. By studying the current limitations of the SBOM and AIBOM, this study aims contributes to advancing cyber supply chain security, reducing organizational risks, and enhancing compliance with evolving cybersecurity regulations.

## Background on SBOM & AIBOM

The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and the Artificial Intelligence Bill of Materials (AIBOM) are two Bill of Materials (BOL) that provide transparency of components for third party acquired systems. As reported by Hassan (2024), the SBOM can help organizations identify components in acquired software which will help secure their software supply chain process, reducing risks associated with acquiring vulnerable software. And according to Hassan (2024), the AIBOM will allow organizations to review the makeup of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that are acquired from third-party sources. Similar to the SBOM, transparency in AI components can help organizations secure their AI supply chain progress and reduce risks of AI attacks.
The SBOM began its life when guidelines for how companies can draft an SBOM were established by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration NITA (2020). “Starting in 2018… NITA began helping industries develop SBOMs by defining them and identifying existing standards that can be used to automatically convey SBOM data” (Thryft, 2021). Since the establishment of these guidelines, the SBOM is still in continual development and refinement. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) hosts regular community driven workstreams to assist in improving the development of the SBOM which are, “intended to enhance the software and security communities’ understanding of SBOM creation, use, and implementation across the broader technology ecosystem” (CISA, 2020). The development of the SBOM hopes to assist in solving the issue presented by open source software that is provided by third parties. It accomplishes this goal by providing clear transparency to all components in software and will reveal any vulnerabilities associated with the software. In 2021, President Biden issued executive order number 14028. This action was created to, “identify, deter, protect against, detect, and respond to these actions and actors” (Biden, 2021). This order directed the NIST to develop draft guidelines for organizations to follow to create an SBOM for federal procurement.
In contrast to the SBOM, the AIBOM is a relatively new concept with a relative lack of research. It can be argued that the idea for the AIBOM was introduced by the U.S. Army. According to Brown and Travers (2024), the U.S.’s Army Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors (PEO IEW&S) announced a request for information (RFI) on how to implement a proposed AIBOM concept. Similar to how the SBOM provides transparency for organizations to be aware of vulnerable software components, the AIBOM should provide transparency for all AI related components. Normally, if an organization wishes to introduce AI technology into their organization, they must either create AI in house or use an existing AI model. If an organization wishes to use an existing AI model from a supplier, a method of examining the AI and Machine Learning (ML) components would be needed to ensure no compromised components are present in the AI model before it is introduced to an organization. The AIBOM will cover the specific components that the SBOM and Hardware Bill of Materials (HBOM) do not cover in an AI/ML model.

## Need for Study

The need to study the current issues and proposed improvements for the SBOM and AIBOM will ultimately help guide organizations to improve their security posture and risk management structure when implementing third-party software and AI components. Uncovering any issues with the SBOM can help spark community wide discussion and research for improvements. Similarly, research on potential formats and standards for the AIBOM can assist organizations to understand the composition, functionality, and potential security flaws of their open-sourced acquired AI system. Improving the transparency in the procurement process of open-source components, such as software components, has proven to be a critical step in protecting organizations from network attacks. According to Crane (2022), the majority, or about 75%, of software components used by organizations are obtained from open-sourced codebases. Also, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research (2024), over 90 percent of major Fortune 500 companies use open-source software products. Because most software used by organizations comes from open sources, Fortinet (2023), states that attackers may be capable of infecting software with malware from those open sources before it is introduced to an organization. If this affected software was distributed to organizations, then all organizations receiving this affected software can potentially affect their systems with malware. And with the increased use of AI, the threat of vulnerable third-party AI components can also pose a security risk for organizations.
	Although much research and development has taken place to form the SBOM into its current state, it is far from perfect. For instance, according to Toomey (2023), the SBOM suffers from a lack of standardization and a lack of adoption. Alrich (2024b), also believes that the NVD has serious issues with linking Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) names to new vulnerability updates to the CVE database. Alrich (2024b), reports that this issue will result in an NVD user being unaware of updated CVE vulnerabilities because they were not yet assigned a CPE name. Alrich (2024b), reports that this issue is an internal issue with NIST. According to Alrich (2024b), NIST is aware of issues, but the NVS are in a major technical debt that they are struggling to escape which is resulting in attempts to resolve this issue to be delayed. In addition, in a 2023 empirical study by Xia et al. (2023), researchers discovered that the majority of SBOM practitioners agree that there is no global consensus for what should be included on the SBOM; “Despite official recommendations on minimum SBOM data fields, there is still a lack of consensus on what to include in SBOMs” (Xia et al., 2023). Due to these obvious issues, it is clear that further research is needed to improve the quality of the SBOM.
The introduced AIBOM concept also has many flaws. For instance, Freedberg (2024), reports that there was an industry outcry in the initial posting of this RFI and the RFI for the original AIBOM concept of having a detailed list of AI components was modified. According to Brown and Travers (2024), the modified concept from the RFI only includes certain aspects of the AI’s algorithm. However, professionals still protest this concept and cite multiple shortcomings. For example, the concept “would not be able to provide a complete security audit of the given AI model because certain aspects of model training and usage cannot be captured statically… Additionally, the AIBOM tool would miss important AI/ML-specific downstream systems” (Brown & Travers, 2024). Additional issues are also cited to exist in implementing an AIBOM. For instance, M. Brown (personal communication, 2023), mentions that an AI/ML weakness database, much like MITRE’s CVE, would need to be available for effective auditing of AI/ML systems. With the debate over the quality of the proposed AIBOM concept, further research is needed to understand if the current concept would be effective in preventing AI based attacks or if alternative concepts would be necessary.
	Researching the potential for future and global implementation of the SBOM and AIBOM would be needed to provide organizations with transparency to security flaws and will assist organizations adhering to current and any potential future governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) policies and regulations. Adhering to these guidelines and regulations is critical for organizations who operate in specific countries and within specific industries. For instance, according to the reports of Deepa Shivaram (2024), President Biden signed an executive order which provided specific guidelines for how federal agencies can and cannot use AI. Deepa Shivaram (2024) reports that these new guidelines are designed to help manage risks associated with AI and will require that each federal agency appoints a chief artificial intelligence officer. These agencies have the deadline of December 1st, 2024, to implement these updated AI safeguards. One of the many AI safeguards in this executive order is an increased transparency of the components from AI models that agencies  are using; “Under the new guidance, agencies are required to share online each year an inventory of how they’re using AI and what risks are associated” (Shivaram, 2024). Because this new executive order requires the transparency of use and components of AI models, the concept of an AIBOM could become a potential benefit for these agencies. An improved SBOM and proper AIBOM can help additional organizations with compliance and regulations. For instance, according to Hassan (2024), the U.S. The Food and Drug Administration requires organizations to manage all components in AI and software medical devices. Because both the SBOM and AIBOM are imperfect, further research on how to improve these BOLs would be needed to assist organizations adhering to compliance regulations and improve their overall security posture.
 
## Focus of Research

The research will focus on identifying current struggles that SBOM practitioners are experiencing with the SBOM, and issues organizations are experiencing with implementing the AIBOM concept. Xia et al. (2023), outlines a number of issues with the SBOM that SBOM practitioners are experiencing and include lack of universal standard, lack of mature tooling, and lack of vulnerability management. Because the AIBOM is a more recent concept compared to the SBOM, OWASP (2024), cites that there is no current AIBOM standard format, this research will aim at uncovering what may be needed for an AIBOM standardized format to exist and what areas of future research would be needed to implement such a concept. This research will also aim to identify SBOM standardization strategies that could also be potentially relevant to the AIBOM. Because Alrich (2024b) cites that the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is relevant for a reliable SBOM, this research will also focus on current issues with vulnerability databases, such as the NVD and will present research and possible solutions to improve the state of the NVD. This research will uncover and review suggestions for improvements for both the SBOM and AIBOM. Identifying all the issues related to these BOMs will help with identifying ideas for improvements. Improving any issues will allow both BOMs to accomplish their intended goal to identify vulnerabilities and help organizations improve their risk management and security posture.



### Current Problems with SBOM & AIBOM

With modernized organizations increasing their dependency on complex software and AI systems, these organizations are now faced with the growing challenge of managing transparency, security, and accountability across their supply chains. The SBOM was introduced as a solution to record all software components to promote clear visibility of software structures, helping to reduce software vulnerabilities being introduced into their network system. Similarly, AIBOMs are an emerging concept designed to provide organizations with transparency to third-party acquired AI models. According to Hassan (2024), a formal AIBOM would allow organizations to view the documented information on how data is trained for AI models, the models software components, hardware components, the models performance metric, and architecture. An AIBOM would need to generate these documents to provide what most consider, according to Hassan (2024), full transparency on AI and ML systems.
Organizations seeking to take advantage of the SBOM and the AIBOM will experience notable challenges. For instance, as reported by Alrich (2024e), the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) has a significant backlog of CPE reports where, “the NVD has not assigned a CPE name” (Alrich, 2024e). For context, created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (2024d), a CPE is a naming scheme to identify software components and additional IT systems. CPEs are relevant to the SBOM because, “CPE information contained within SBOMs can be queried against NVD search tools to discover potential related vulnerabilities” (The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, 2021). As reported by Millman (2024), the backlog of unprocessed CVEs totaled around 7,000 CVEs with no CPE identifiers in April of 2024. According to Alrich (2024e), this means that a cybersecurity professional analyzing the SBOM for CVEs would not discover all CVEs because a significant number of CVEs will be missing a CPE identifier. According to Alrich (2024e), this is an issue because a CPE identifier is frequently used to discover CVEs and critical vulnerabilities in software. In short, an SBOM may not uncover a CVE because it may be missing a CPE identifier. Due to this issue, an acquired source of software can have a CVE, but the organization would be unaware because it may not have a CPE name at the time of acquisition. In addition to the issue of missing CPE names, the SBOM is plagued with additional issues. For instance, according to MITRE (2024), there are currently multiple and different SBOM standards. MITRE (2024), also notes that some current SBOM standards include SPDX and CycloneDX, both being used to specify SBOM elements. And according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (2021), these multiple standards have few overlapping information but, “have historically been used at different points in the software lifecycle and are consumed by different types of users” (National Telecommunications and Information Administration, 2021). Multiple standards lead to the issue of, “multiple naming and formatting conventions” (MITRE, 2024). This is an issue because the, “lack of standardization leads to inconsistencies in the content and presentation of SBOMs across various tools, platforms, and organizations” (Mello, 2024). According to Mello (2024), the variety of standardization formats for the SBOM is an issue for cybersecurity professionals because it will create confusion and inconsistency within the software ecosystem.
Because the AIBOM is a more recent concept when compared to the SBOM, it is less researched and is faced with similar and additional issues that the SBOM is faced with. For example, according to NIST (2024b), the AIBOM is not aligned with any technical standards such as SPDX and CDX and there are no established best practices for creating, managing, and using an AIBOM. There are additional issues for building an AIBOM. For instance, Lim (2024) states that there are privacy concerts that need to be considered to protect intellectual property rights of an AI model. For instance, according to Chuks-Okeke et al. (2024), international intellectual property (IP) law only protects creations from the human mind. And because AI systems are able to generate answers and responses for themselves, laws and regulations surrounding IP would need to be adjusted to account for AI systems. According to Chuks-Okeke et al. (2024), laws are already beginning to be adjusted. For instance, Chuks-Okeke et al. (2024), states that the EU AI Act is requesting that AI developers document all aspects of AI systems. An AIBOM has the potential to be used in this situation because it will provide documentation of an AI system. This could potentially aid AI developers to provide the required documentation for the EU AI Act.
Dmitry Raidman from aibom-squad (2024), argues that another limiting factor for an AIBOM to be used in 2024 is the lack of vulnerability databases. For instance, Dmitry Raidman argues that vulnerability databases should exist separate from CVEs. For professionals searching for vulnerabilities, there is currently a limited number of vulnerability databases for AI and ML systems. For instance, the AI Vulnerability Database (AVID) (2023), is an organization that stores evidence of AI failures in a format similar to the CVE. Another AI related vulnerability database is Sightline by Protect AI. According to Protect AI (2024), Sightline relies on a community of AI/ML penetration testers to report AI and ML vulnerabilities. However, it can be argued that a limited number of vulnerability databases for AI and ML systems may be unable to find all vulnerabilities to its system.

## Significance of Study
It is critical for more research to be conducted on the SBOM and AIBOM because both BOM’s help organizations to discover critical components and potential vulnerabilities within their supply chain. According to the Department for Science, Innovation & Technology (2024), failing to secure software and AI components from third parties could lead to issues with system integrity and may result in a potential data breach and system compromise.
There are multiple observed instances of supply chain related attacks on software systems. One example of a software supply chain attack is the hack on SolarWinds. SolarWinds (2016) is a large-scale corporation that provides services and much of the software products used by other organizations such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Walmart, and McDonalds. They also provide software and services for the federal government. One platform they provide is known as their Orion Platform; “The SolarWinds Orion Platform is a powerful, scalable infrastructure monitoring and management platform designed to simplify IT administration for on-premises, hybrid, and software as a service (SaaS) environments” (SolarWinds, 2016). This is a powerful platform that many organizations, such as the ones previously described, benefit from. However, a team of hackers were successfully able to exploit a vulnerability in this platform.
Keith Barker, from CBT Nuggets (2020), explains that attackers were able to inject malware into the Orion Platform. And due to the software supply chain process, this malware was able to affect all the customers using the Orion Platform from SolarWinds. Keith Barker from CBT Nuggets (2020) continues to explain that customers of SolarWinds were affected by this malware due to software updates that SolarWinds sent to its customers. In short, hackers planted malicious code in the Orion Platform as SolarWinds were preparing to distribute software updates, that malware went unnoticed by SolarWinds and was eventually distributed to all organizations using SolarWinds Orion Platform. When the customers of SolarWinds accepted their software update, they unknowingly infected their system with malicious code.
Because of the issues that the SBOM currently faces, such as a backlog of CPE reports and a lack of standardization, attacks similar to the attack on SolarWinds are still possible to occur to other organizations. Cyber-attacks have the potential to financially impact organizations. In fact, according to IBM (2024), the average cost of a data breach due to a cyber-attack can cost an organization about $4.88 million USD. This number helps to illustrate the importance of securing all aspects of an organization's cyber network including their acquisition of software.
It should be stated that AI systems are also vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In fact, according to Perez (2024), if an organization introduces AI into their network, they will be expanding their attack surface and building more risks of attacks from external and internal threat actors. According to MITRE ATLAS (2024), it has been studied that AI systems have many vulnerabilities. For instance, AI systems are, “trained on personally identifiable information, trusted to make critical decisions with little oversight, and have little to no logging and alerting attached to their use” (MITRE ATLAS, 2024). Because AI systems can be trained to handle sensitive information and trusted to make decisions, an attack on a deployed AI system has the ability to become a significant threat to an organization. Multiple research case studies exist on AI system vulnerabilities. For instance, Lanyado (2023), researched an attack on ChatGPT. For context, according to OpenAI (2024), ChatGPT is a powerful AI tool that can be used by enterprises and individuals. Lanyado (2023), discovered that can be manipulated to generate fake URLs, references, and code libraries. With this vulnerability from ChatGPT, Lanyado (2023), was able to use ChatGPT to spread malicious packages which Lanyado (2023), refers to as “AI package hallucination.” With this attack, Lanyado (2023), was able to manipulate ChatGPT to convince an unexpecting victim to install a malicious package.
According to Lanyado (2023), the best way for organizations and individuals to prevent AI attacks, such as AI package hallucinations, is to ensure the AI system libraries are legitimate; “Given how these actors pull off supply chain attacks by deploying malicious libraries to known repositories, it’s important for developers to vet libraries” (Lanyado, 2023). This is where an AIBOM can become useful. This is because a proper AIBOM, as according to Hassan (2024), will be capable of vetting the entire AI system and scanning for potential vulnerabilities such as AI package hallucinations.
Because of present day challenges that organizations and AI developers are experiencing with adhering to evolving AI transparency standards and the issues that the SBOM is facing, such as a backlog of CPE reports for CVEs and lack of a unison and global standard SBOM format, it is apparent that there is a need to research the causes of these issues and uncover solutions to these problems. Discovering potential solutions may assist organizations with managing cyber risks due to attacks from open-sourced acquired software and AI systems. In addition to improving security for organizations, the potential implementation of an AIBOM and improved SBOM may also benefit organizations by allowing them to adhere to compliance and regulations.


## Research Question
How can the development of standardized formats and improved tooling for SBOM and AIBOM address security and compliance challenges, and what strategies can enhance the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to support their effective implementation? To address this research question, the researcher will review and analyze existing opinions and literature from SBOM practitioners and AIBOM researchers. Analyzing and leveraging the options from experts in their own unique field of cybersecurity, such as vulnerability management, software, and AI development will assist the researcher to uncover the most efficient solution to improve the current state of the SBOM and understand if the AIBOM is needed and how the AIBOM can be implemented on a global level.
Upon conducting this research, organizations will have the knowledge to judge and consider the most logical and effective solution to address the present-day issues SBOM practitioners are experiencing and this research will help to determine the most effective solution to ensure that both software and AI systems, acquired from open sources, are secure and safe for use.


##Literature Review

Cyber-attacks are able to become a significant concern for organizations. This is because, according to IBM (2024), the average cost of a data breach due to a cyber-attack is around $4.45 million globally in 2023. The troubling reality of this number raises the concern of ensuring open-sourced systems, such as software and AI systems, are safe for consumers to acquire and safe for organizations to provide. According to Arsdale (2024), it has been proven that there is an increased number of incidents where malicious packages are found on open-source software packages. In fact, Arsdale (2024), cites that the number of reported incidents of malicious open-sourced packages has grown 1300% from 2020 to 2023.
There are a number of now well-known and well-reported incidents of software supply chain related attacks. For example, BlueVoyant (2024), reports of an instance where threat actors attacked an organization known as Kaseya. Kaseya is a major organization that provides IT and security management for, “managed service providers (MSPs) and small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs)” (Kaseya, 2021). According to BlueVoyant (2024), attackers were able to infect the software that Kaseya provides to MSPs with ransomware. This ransomware, “was then deployed together with an update to the software” (BlueVoyant, 2024). As reported by BlueVoyant (2024), once the MSPs received this affected software update, their entire system was compromised which ultimately allowed attackers to extort $70 million.
The effects of supply chain attacks can result in both harm to the customers affected by the acquired system and the organization that provided the affected software. For instance, Keith Barker, from CBT Nuggets (2020), describes a major cyber-attack on SolarWinds in 2020 where attackers infected the organizations depending on software updates from SolarWinds with malware. Three years after the SolarWinds incident, Wysopal (2024), reports that the company agreed to pay $26 million in a class-action lawsuit against the company regarding their cyber breach. It should also be noted that many of the attackers who are skilled and capable of attacking these major organizations are still active today. For instance, The U.S. Department of State (2021), currently has an open wanted poster and a reward for $10 million for the attackers that make up this elaborate group known as DarkSide. DarkSide actors have formed a ransomware variant also known as DarkSide; “DarkSide is a ransomware variant that appeared initially in August 2020… The DarkSide ransomware group was responsible for the Colonial Pipeline Company ransomware incident in May 2021” (U.S. Department of State, 2021). This would indicate that ransomware, which may be caused by a software supply chain related attack, can still be a reality for major organizations.
To respond to the threat of software supply chain attacks, in May of 2021, President Biden issued executive order number 14028. This action was created to, “identify, deter, protect against, detect, and respond to these actions and actors” (The White House, 2021). This order directed the NIST to develop guidelines for organizations to follow to create a SBOM for federal procurement. The NIST also defined a set of minimal elements that should be included in an SBOM which include, “package name, version, unique identifier, licensing information, dependencies, known security vulnerabilities and software hash” (Rangari, 2023). Using the guidelines established by NITA, third party software providers working for the federal government must meet the standards of proper formation of an SBOM. Table 1 shows the three minimal elements required for an SBOM and was adopted by NITA (2021).

## Table 1
### Minimum Elements for SBOM
| **Name** | **Description** |
| --------- | -------- |
| Data Fields | “Document baseline information about component” |
| Automation Support | “Support automation… to allow for scaling across the software ecosystem” |
|Practices and Processes | “Define the operations of SBOM requests, generation and use” |
            	Note: From “The Minimum Elements for an SBOM,” by (NITA, 2021).

However, these standards are not universal and required for organizations outside of the U.S. federal government. It should be noted that other foreign agencies have their own set of guidelines for drafting SBOMs. According to Rangari (2023), other cyber agencies include, The EU Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), and The Canadian Communications Security Establishment (CSE). Again, these agencies have their own set of guidelines created for companies to follow to develop SBOMs.

If an organization plans to develop and generate an SBOM, CISA has established six different types of SBOMs that an organization is able to generate. Spiewak (2023), notes that the six different SBOM types include “Design,” “Source,” “Build,” “Analyzed,” “Deployed,” and “Runtime.” Each type of SBOM has its own purpose and definition. Table 2 is adopted from Spiewak (2023) and lists the six types of SBOMs that can be made along with a brief description of how they are generated.

## Table 2
### CISA's SBOM Types
| **Name** | **Description** |
| -------- | -------- |
| Design | “Derived from a design specification, RFP, or initial concept” |
| Source | “Generated from software composition analysis (SCA) tooling” |
| Build | “Generated as part of the process of building the software” |
| Analyzed | “Generated through analysis of artifacts by 3rd party tooling” |
| Deployed | “Generated by recording the SBOMs and configuration information of artifacts that have been installed on systems” |
| Runtime | “Generated from tooling interacting with system to record the artifacts present in a running environment” |
    Note: From “CISA’s 6 SBOM Types,” by (Spiewak, 2023).

All the listed SBOMs can be generated by organizations to assist in satisfying a consumer's request for a SBOM and all the six generation methods will provide the requester with a different SBOM. But it should be noted that if an organization is required to generate an SBOM to meet the minimal elements required that were established by NITA, then Synopsys (n.d.) would recommend using the Build and Analyzed methods for generating an SBOM. This is because these two methods of generation will generate a SBOM that complies with the minimal elements required to be included on an SBOM.

Although guidelines and resources exist for organizations to generate and provide SBOMs to consumers, the SBOM is still not universally required, and security professionals are currently having conversations to correct underlying issues. In order to research some of the current issues with the SBOM, Xia et al. (2023), published a study in 2023 where they interviewed and surveyed security professionals and SBOM practitioners on their opinion on the current state of SBOMs. This study helps to illustrate the general opinion of the SBOM from security professionals and some of the specific problems facing the SBOM today from software industry adaptation.

Toomey (2023) notes that more than 80% of respondents, from the survey conducted by Xia et al. (2023), felt that adaptation for the SBOM across the software industry is lagging. A key reason as to why the SBOM is not globally adopted is because there is a lack of consensus on what an SBOM is required to include. Although there are many guidelines and recommendations for organizations to generate an SBOM, “63% of respondents agreed that in practice, generated SBOMs don’t always meet the minimum bar” (Toomey, 2023). As previously mentioned, multiple federal agencies have their own set of recommendations for what an SBOM should include. The respondents in the study from Xia et al. (2023) believe that the software industry is struggling to provide SBOMs because there is no universally accepted standard for what to include on an SBOM. This indicates that more research is needed for universally accepted and global SBOM.

Another hurdle facing the SBOM is a lack of mature tooling for generation; “The majority of respondents (65%) agreed that SBOM tools can be hard to use due to various reasons” (Toomey, 2023). Because tools to generate an SBOM can be challenging to use in situations, the organization may not be able to produce and provide a proper SBOM. This means that the tools for generating SBOMs must be accurate and easy to use by organizations to generate an SBOM. More research is needed for mature tooling.

Another key finding in the study by Xia et al. (2023), is that the majority of respondents felt that there is a lack of strategic vulnerability management; “While vulnerabilities should be uncovered, not all vulnerabilities are exploitable, so vulnerability management needs to be strategic” (Toomey, 2023). CISA has created a document called “Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX).” The purpose of VEX, “is to allow a software supplier or other parties to assert the status of specific vulnerabilities in a particular product” (CISA, 2022). This is beneficial for organizations because if multiple vulnerabilities are discovered, they can use a VEX document to focus their time on mitigating the vulnerabilities that pose the highest security risk. However, this research study from Xia et al. (2023) found that the respondents are skeptical on the reliability of VEX. In fact, one respondent is quoted by saying, “I don’t agree that the ones defined less exploitable are not valuable… Hackers can take their time, and they can find a way to put together a lot of things that look very not exploitable, and… find themselves with very easy and exploitable access” (Xia et al., 2023). Based on the research study of Xia et al. (2023), it is apparent that the SBOM is imperfect and needs continual development and refinement in order to be easily accepted and adapted within the software supply industry.

The SBOM community is also experiencing significant issues with the NVD. According to Alrich (2024b), the NVD is experiencing a major issue where there is a backlog of missing CPE names for CVE IDs. According to Chin (2024), NIST maintains the NVD and the NVD is responsible for, “adding data to vulnerabilities that have been assigned a CVE ID” (Chin, 2024). However, according to Chin (2024), the NVD is experiencing an issue where there is a reported number of 2,546 CVEs that are missing IDs as of February 12th, 2024. This is a concern because, “many companies rely on NVD data for their security operations and vulnerability research” (Chin, 2024). NIST seems to be aware of this issue and even posted an announcement in 2024 that reads; “There is a growing backlog of vulnerabilities submitted to the NVD and requiring analysis” (NIST, 2024). According to the announcement from NIST (2024), they are attempting to establish a consortium with organizations to collaborate on research to improve the NVD.

The SBOM Forum (2022), provides the recommendation to use purl identifiers and the issue would be resolved; “A purl or package URL is an attempt to standardize existing approaches to reliably identify and locate software packages” (package-url, 2017). According to The SBOM Forum (2022), purl would be able to help resolve NVDs issue of missing CPE names because it is capable of locating multiple software packages in a uniform manner.

However, this solution may be impossible to implement. According to Alrich (2024b), the NVD would need to change the current CVE JSON spec and update it to CVE JSON 5.1 spec. According to JSON Schema (2024), the JSON Scheme can ensure that JSON data adheres to a defined structure, making it easier for developers to validate and document data. Alrich (2024b) reports that the NVD would need to complete the implementation of the CVE JSON 5.0 spec before the update. This is an issue because, according to Alrich (2024b), in order to upgrade and use purl, the NVD would need to have a consortium and meet with stakeholders. According to Alrich (2024b), it is questionable if the consortium will ever happen. This is mostly due to the expected timeline and requirements for the consortium to be successful. For instance, according to Alrich (2024d), organization joining will work for free, pay a fee, and be willing to spend, “months negotiating a Cooperative R&D Agreement (CRADA) with NIST” (Alrich, 2024d). Alrich (2024d), is concerned that the NVD will be unable to implement purl identifiers for at least several years because the consortium will take time and will have to address a number of additional issues that the NVD is looking to improve upon. In the situation where purl was used, it will need to be improved because, according to Alrich (2024c), purl is currently unable to identify commercial software. Because of this, Alrich (2024c), speculates that it may take 5 years for purl to be used to identify both commercial and open-source software. Because the NVD is a critical resource for SBOM practitioners to identify software vulnerabilities, it is clear that more research needs to be conducted to find an alternative solution to identifying vulnerable software components from open source and commercial sources.

With the development of new technologies and AI systems, the AIBOM is currently in need of research for development and growth. The need for research is due to a variety of reasons because global governments are beginning to issue regulations for AI systems. For example, President Biden from The White House (2023), issued an executive order to make AI-based models more accountable. AI systems can be complex and can be made from many components and are dependent on the ML model. According to Manifest (2023), the most efficient method to document information from a ML model is to use a model card; “Model cards are a method to structure information that describes an ML model” (Manifest, 2023).  Due to the complex nature of AI and ML systems, researchers are attempting to understand the components of AI systems that should be included in an AIBOM. One researcher, Lim (2024), recommends that the AIBOM should include a specific inventory of components such as components on, training data, data sources, software frameworks, hardware, dependencies, and package managers. As previously mentioned, multiple researchers and organizations are racing to research the AIBOM. One organization includes Manifest. According to manifest-cyber (2023a), Manifest conducts research on the AIBOM by connecting with AI/ML experts to develop an AIBOM and uncover use cases along with potential issues. Manifest (2023), published a whitepaper focused on the AIBOM and outlines methods and standards for documenting all components, processes, and decisions that are involved in the development and deployment of an AI system. Manifest (2023), vision for an AIBOM is to make AI/ML datasets accountable, reveal the software and hardware components in AI/ML systems, and identify any copyright license. According to Manifest (2023), their research has identified critical model details and metadata that make up an AI/ML system that should be included on an AIBOM. According to Manifest (2023), this data includes, model name, model version, model type, model developer, license(s), software dependencies, source/URL where model can be accessed, documentation related to model development, and attestations to authenticate model.

Even with all the research that has been conducted on the AIBOM thus far, there are notable areas of future research and development needed for the AIBOM. For example, Manifest (2023), believes that some key areas of research include how to allow an AIBOM to retrieve structured data of AI models, development on AIBOM generation tools, and how to structure an AIBOM to contain information on an AI models lineage. Manifest (2023), also believes that there is a lack of consistent and unique naming convention for AI/ML models. For instance, AI/ML models may need to have a more unique naming convention that is similar and superior to the CPE schema that is regularly used to identify software components. Due to these gaps in the research of an AIBOM, it is apparent that more research will need to be conducted by researchers and organizations alike.

The research that has been performed in recent years on the SBOM and AIBOM shows that there is a lack of standardization and quality tooling for the SBOM and AIBOM and that practitioners are struggling to rely upon the NVD to identify vulnerabilities. Researched issues related to the SBOM, according to Xia et al. (2023), include a lack of universal standardization, poor quality tooling, and reliable vulnerability identification. Problems with the AIBOM are similar to the SBOM and, according to Manifest (2023), include the need for AIBOM tooling, need of standardization, and a quality vulnerability identification system for AI and ML models. The previously described issues surrounding the SBOM and AIBOM may produce unnecessary difficulty and work for organizations to view critical components of software and AI systems. Being able to view these components can allow organizations to avoid using vulnerable components thus protecting their organization from advanced threat actors, such as the DarkSide group. Easily using the SBOM and AIBOM to ensure safe procurement of open-sourced acquired software and AI systems may provide organizations with additional security for their network. In addition to potentially increasing security, the use of a SBOM and AIBOM also has the potential to allow organizations to follow all regulations and government standards. Such as the guidelines established from executive order number 14028 from Biden (2021), and the executive order passed by The White House (2023), to make AI models more accountable.

This paper aims to compile all issues related to the SBOM and AIBOM. Compiling existing researched issues and analyzing them in a structured manner will aid in the analysis of the technical and organizational barriers for integration of the SBOM and AIBOM, such as standardization issues and resource limitations. In order to address the issues related to the SBOM, this paper will review the complaints from SBOM practitioners in the SBOM community for the purpose of uncovering a realistic solution and find areas for future research for each individually agreed upon complaint with the SBOM. This paper will also analyze the complaints and information from researchers and professionals from NIST and the NVD. Reviewing the issues related to the NVD find solutions for the issues related to the NVD. This should help in the improvement of the SBOM because, according to NIST (2019), the NVD is used to identify software vulnerabilities that may be present on a SBOM. This research will then review various AIBOM concepts to understand what additional research would be needed for the AIBOM to be standardized. Ultimately, this research will help aid researchers and organizations to analyze the steps needed for the successful implementation of a standard and universally approved SBOM and AIBOM. The end goal of this research is to present information on the current issues related to the SBOM and AIBOM and provide recommendations for improving the current state of the SBOM and AIBOM and discuss the potential areas of future research.

## Results

### SBOM
#### Standards and Formats

According to Braun (2024), a common gripe in the SBOM community is the competition of multiple frameworks. The intention for this section is to review two well-known and widely used formats, such as CycloneDX and SPDX, for the purpose of later comparison.

##### CycloneDX

CycloneDX (2024a), can provide users with the option to use up to five fields to identify any known software vulnerabilities. According to CycloneDX (2024a), these fields include CPE, Package URL (PURL), SWID, OmniBOR ID, and SWHID. In addition to vulnerability management, CycloneDX has further use cases. For instance, CycloneDX (2024a), can incorporate SPDX license IDs for the purpose of identifying any potential licenses within an acquired software component. Identifying software licenses can help organizations adhere to copyright laws and comply with licensing agreements. CycloneDX (2024b), is currently Ecma International standard; “Ecma International is a not-for-profit industry association of technology developers, vendors, and users founded in 1961 and dedicated to the standardization of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Consumer Electronics (CE)” (CycloneDX, 2024b). It should also be noted that according to Das (2023), CycloneDX can give users the option to create Software as a Service Bill of Materials (SaaBOMs), Hardware Bill of Materials (HBOM), Machine Learning Bill of Materials (ML-BOM), Operational Bill of Materials (OBOM), Vulnerability disclosure reports, and Vulnerability Exploitation exchange (VEX). According to Das (2023), Vulnerability disclosure reports can assist organizations with identifying software vulnerabilities in SBOMs by providing documentation of known vulnerabilities. According to Das (2023), a VEX document can provide cybersecurity professionals with guidance to and remediation strategies to reduce the severity of any found vulnerabilities. This is because, “CycloneDX is aligned much more closely with cybersecurity use cases, and as such, sees increased adoption with many cybersecurity tool providers and vendors” (Turner, 2024). Thanks to the research conducted by Das (2023) and Turner (2024), it is obvious that CycloneDX is formatted in a manner to allow cybersecurity professionals to analyze open-sourced shared software. This means that CycloneDX has an advantage of allowing organizations to view potential software vulnerabilities from acquired sources.

##### SPDX

According to The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (2021), SPDX is an ISO/IEC 5962:2021 standard. Within the SBOM generated with SPDX (2023), consumers can find information on any software vulnerabilities and software licenses. Security teams can use SPDX to reference, “Common Platform Enumeration, Software Heritage persistent ID or Package URL” (Das, 2023). The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (2021), states that a main feature of SPDX is that it can provide users with a wealth of information related to intellectual property and licenses information. Based on the research and information provided by The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (2021) and Das (2023), SPDX could generate a detailed SBOM that is formatted to provide software information that is highly relevant to all individuals involved with analyzing software such as developers, security teams, and legal teams.

### CPE Identifiers

The data collected for the tables in this section was pulled from National Vulnerability Database (NVD) (2024). The numbers that are highlighted in this section include only the new official CPE entries that were reported by NVD (2024). The purpose of including this data from NVD (2024), is to generate a trend analysis in order to view changes of CPE entries in the NVD from the year 2020 to the current date. A trend analysis will provide insight into the project number of CPEs that will be expected to be uploaded in the NVD in future years if the NVD does not adjust the current method of how CPEs are uploaded into the NVD. This should help to provide information on the significance of the NVDs issues relating to CPE identifiers. Table 1 shows the current number of official CPE entries into the NVD. Because this data was pulled from the NVD (2024), before the end of the year 2024, the data for year 2024 in Table 1 does not include any data from the month of December. Table 2 accounts for this discrepancy by calculating the monthly average CPE entries for the month of December, from 2020 to 2023, and using that average number as a prediction for what the final number of CPE entries will be for the month of December in the year 2024.

### Table 1
#### Current Total CPE Entires in NVD Per Year

        Note. Data adapted from (NVD, 2024).

Based on the data provided by the NVD (2024), on average, less CPE names are being uploaded to the NVD over a period of five years. The data also shows that the NVD uploaded over 98,000 more CPE names in 2023 than they have done so far in 2024. Granted, at the time of this report, 2024 has not been concluded and the information for the month of December is not finished and more CPE names can be added into the NVD for 2024. Based on the monthly data collected by NVD (2024), an average of around 18,400 CPE identifiers are likely to be added into the NVD for the month of December from 2020 to 2023. Based on this information and data from NVD (2024), the expected number of total CPE identifiers added to the NVD at the end of 2024 is less than 143,000 CPEs. This still would indicate a downward trend of CPEs being added into the NVD. Table 2 illustrates the projected downward trend of CPE entries being added into the NVD if the end of year CPE entry total is expected to be 143,000 CPEs. Because of the statistical downward trend, Table 1 & 2 help to visually illustrate that the NVD is lacking the resources to update the NVD with CPEs.

## AIBOM
In terms of (IBOM information, a limited amount of research is currently available on AIBOM. However, manifest-cyber (2023b), constructed a proposed AIBOM model. Table 3 is adapted from manifest-cyber (2023b) and is a detailed description of Manifest's proposed AIBOM. Table 4 is based on the information provided by Coleman (2024) and The White House (2024) and highlights key AI related government regulations.

              	Note. Adopted from (Coleman, 2024) & (The White House, 2024).

Although there are current U.S. government regulations on AI systems, there are no current standard AIBOM model and, thanks to the research by manifest-cyber (2023b), no pre-existing SBOM format, such as CycloneDX or SPDX perfectly aligns with the proposed AIBOM format that is presented by manifest-cyber (2023b). However existing SBOM formats can be used to assist with the generation of an AIBOM. For example, manifest-cyber (2023b), was able to generate AIBOMs within the CycloneDX format. Because no AIBOM format is currently available, manifest-cyber (2023), is attempting to work with the CycloneDX community and the SPDX community in order to add their Manifest’s own custom fields into the existing CycloneDX and SPDX format.

## Discussion
### SBOM 
#### Standards and Formats
With a simple overview of the two formats, it is evident that they are similar and can generate vulnerable information for consumers. However, these formats are distinctly different from one another. According to Khan (2023), the primary purpose of SPDX is to assist all individuals involved in the development and distribution process of software. This means that SPDX is beneficial for software developers; “The accessibility of SPDX means that the sole developer of an experimental library can generate an SBOM with minimal effort at no cost” (National Telecommunications and Information Administration, 2021). According to Khan (2023), SPDX is designed to help individuals specifically involved with developers, legal teams and regulators of software. CycloneDX differs from SPDX because, according to Khan (2023), CycloneDX is a simplified structure of software components that are specifically focused on vulnerability management; “CycloneDX helps you create a tidy inventory of what’s in your software, making it easy to spot any vulnerabilities or compliance issues” (Khan, 2023). In short, SPDX has the benefit of simplifying the transparency of software components that are relevant to the work of software developers, legal teams and regulators and CycloneDX was created to highlight software components that are relevant to security teams and cybersecurity professions.

Because both SBOM formats can provide SBOM users and organizations with detailed components of software, both formats are capable of executive order 14028 by Biden (2021), where the order states that organizations must use SBOM when working with the federal government to improve software transparency. However, because executive order 14028 by Joseph Biden (2021), requires SBOMs to highlight vulnerable software components for the purpose of preventing threat actors from attacking potentially vulnerable software components, it can be argued that CycloneDX may be SBOM for SBOM practitioners when working with the federal government. This is because, according to The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (2021), a main use case of CycloneDX is to provide organizations the ability to perform software supply chain risk assessment. However, it should also be re-stated that SPDX is also able to provide insight to vulnerable software components. Because of this, both CycloneDX and SPDX can be used for federal acquisition of software. Ultimately, further research would be needed to incorporate the benefits of CycloneDX and SPDX into one format or improve the quality of both formats. According to Braun (2024), the benefit of having a unified SBOM may help enhance software supply chain security. Braun (2024), notes that this is because a single SBOM standard may help improve tooling and improve clarity and consistency in the software ecosystem. Because Xia et al. (2023), discovered that many SBOM practitioners criticize the SBOM for having a lack of adaptation and lack of mature tooling, further research on the effort to generate a universal SBOM standard and format may help improve these criticisms Xia et al. (2023), found in their survey from SBOM practitioners.

### NVD & CPE
According to the data from NVD (2024), and the trend analysis of Table 1 AND Table 2, it is apparent that CPEs are being uploaded to the NVD at a less efficient rate than in previous years. Because SBOM practitioners, according to Alrich (2023), regularly use CPE identifiers to uncover Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) in software systems, the reality that fewer CPEs are being uploaded to the NVD highlights that in order to identify software vulnerabilities from SBOMs, the NVD would need to improve its current process of uploading CPE identifiers. Improving the CPE mapping to CVEs may help improve the quality of the current state of the SBOM when using it to identify software vulnerabilities. It can be speculated that the lack of CPEs being updated to the NVD may be due to fewer vulnerabilities being found in 2024. This could cause fewer CPEs being uploaded to the NVD in 2024 when compared to prior years. But that speculation is disproven by Baines (2024). This is because, according to Baines (2024), NIST NVD only provided around 41% of CPE entries into the NVD for the year 2024 thus far. Baines (2024), states that Vulncheck provided 77% of CPE identifiers for CVEs published in 2024. This is significant information because, “it is likely that VulnCheck’s CPEs will be accepted by the NVD” (Alrich, 2024). This information illustrates that the NVD may not be the most efficient and reliable database for vulnerabilities. It should also be stated that there is a noticeable backlog of CVEs without CPEs. According to Alrich (2024e), there were 18,790 CVEs with missing CPE identifiers in the month of February for the year 2024. This number of CVEs with missing CPEs is a significant increase from prior years. In fact, according to Sanguino and Uetz (2024), a total of 895 CVE entries were missing CPEs in 2017. This would indicate that, in addition to the decline of CPEs being added to the NVD, there are still CVEs being reported and missing identifiers.

Alternative software identifiers to CPEs have been studied by Alrich (2023), and potential candidates for software identifiers include OmniBOR and Purl. According to OmniBOR (2024), OmniBOR can allow users to, “identify and cross-reference information for software artifacts without a central authority” (OmniBOR, 2024). According to Alrich (2023), a hurdle that is preventing OmniBOR from becoming a well-known and universal software identifier is that OmniBOR will require all vendors of software to implement needed changes to their software products. Alrich (2023), speculates that if OmniBOR was pursued, these changes may take up to 10 years to occur. One of the most admired software identifiers in the SBOM community is purl. According to Alrich (2023), a major flaw of purl is that it is not universal and, “only works for identifying software that is available for download from a specific internet location” (Alrich, 2023). According to Alrich (2023), additional research would be needed to require software suppliers to add purl identifiers to their products at a specific location. Alrich (2023), states that it is highly unlikely that CPE will be replaced as an identifier because it is currently supported by the NVD and is linked to the entire CVE database.

Although NIST and the NVD provide a valuable resource for SBOM practitioners to identify potential vulnerabilities in software, further research would need to be conducted across the vulnerability database and SBOM community to resolve NVDs issue with missing CPE identifiers. Potential future areas of research introduce purl identifiers in the NVD. According to Alrich (2024a), introducing purl identifiers has the potential to help remediate the NVDs issue with missing CPE identifiers for CVEs. Improving the state of the NVD may improve the quality of SBOMs when using them to uncover CVEs.

To summarize areas of future research aimed at improving the current state of the SBOM, industry wide research on improved SBOM formats may be needed to ease many of the complaints found by Xia et al. (2023), such as lack of industry wide and global adaptation. In addition, more research would need to be conducted by individuals of NIST and the NVD to improve NVDs' issue with missing CPE identifiers for CVEs. Focusing on these areas of research may assist with improving the current state of the SBOM.

### AIBOM

AIBOM
Because no existing fields are in existence for Manifest’s AIBOM, additional research would be required to create a standard format, preferably a format that can obtain ISO/IEC standardization or a format that can reach the level of Ecma International standard. However, before such AIBOM format is created, additional research and work would be required to understand the necessary fields needed for an AIBOM. Based on the AIBOM proposed by manifest-cyber (2023b), examples of custom fields that would need to be added into preexisting SBOM formats may include information on how AI models are trained, such as datasets, licenses related to the datasets, source of the datasets, model name, version, and type, and information on the input and output scheme for the AI model. These custom fields for an AIBOM can significantly benefit organizations adhering to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). According to FAR (2019), section 889 restricts the use of certain technologies. These technologies could include AI systems. Because of the recommended fields from manifest-cyber (2023b), Manifest’s AIBOM may provide organizations with information about these AI components so that they can comply with the NDAA. In addition, due to an increased number of regulations are being introduced that relate to AI systems. According to White and Case (2024), examples of AI related regulations include the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act, National Defense Authorization Act, and National AI Initiative Act of 2020. An AIBOM, such as the example from manifest-cyber (2023b), has the potential to allow organizations to view documented components of AI systems for compliance with AI related regulations. Also, according to manifest-cyber (2023b), because an AIBOM requires a list of software licenses associated with an AI system, an AIBOM can allow organizations to comply with licenses laws and regulations that relate to the use of AI systems. The AIBOM from manifest-cyber (2023b), also has the potential to provide organizations with clarity on whether or not their acquired AI system is vulnerable to cyber-attacks. According to Lumenova (2024), an example of a cyber-attack on an AI system is a poisoning attack. According to Lumenova (2024), a poison attack is when a threat actor manipulates training data for ML models. Because the AIBOM from manifest-cyber (2023b), requires information on datasets of AI models, cyber security professionals can reference the AI systems datasets to view for potential tempering and cyber-attacks. Thanks to the work by manifest-cyber (2023b), Manifest’s AIBOM has the potential to solve the problem of managing AI vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance with potential AI licenses. However, more research would be needed to form a standardized AIBOM format to allow organizations and individuals to generate a reliable AIBOM.

## Conclusion

With the emergence of new and evolving software and AI technologies comes the pressing need to manage these technologies for security and compliance reasons. The SBOM has proven to be a valuable tool for analyzing software components, enabling organizations to mitigate vulnerabilities and comply with regulatory and licensing requirements. However, this research has highlighted that the SBOM is far from perfect and requires further development. Specifically, implementing a unified SBOM format would improve consistency within the software exchange community. Additionally, addressing limitations in the NVD, such as its inability to attach CPE identifiers to all CVEs, requires community-wide research and collaboration to enhance the dependability of SBOMs for identifying software vulnerabilities.

Similarly, with the rapid adoption of new AI technologies, an AIBOM, such as the example provided by manifest-cyber (2023b), has significant potential to document the components of AI systems, ensuring compliance with AI-related regulations and licenses while mitigating risks of AI-related supply chain attacks. Future research must focus on defining a standardized and universally accepted AIBOM format. Furthermore, improved tooling for generating and analyzing AIBOMs is essential, alongside enhancements to the NVD and CPE identifiers, to better identify vulnerabilities within the software components of AI systems.

This research underscores the importance of standardization, improved tooling, and collaboration in addressing the challenges of adopting SBOMs and AIBOMs. Enhancing the reliability of the NVD and aligning community efforts toward these goals will ensure these tools effectively support the security and compliance needs of modern organizations.
